MODULE:  hillshade

PURPOSE:  Performs the hillshade algorithm (from GDALDEM) to compute the
shaded relief for the current 3x3 window.

RETURN VALUE:
Type = float 
Value      Description
-----      -----------
0.0 - 1.0  Represents the shaded relief for the current pixel area.  These
           numbers represent the amount of light that is reaching that surface
           based on the sun angles, the slope of the area, and the aspect of
           that area.  Therefore the higher the value, the more the sun
           actually directly lights that pixel.

12/31/2012  Gail Schmidt     Original Development (based on GDALHillshade
                             algorithm in GDALDEM v1.9.2)
02/01/2013  Gail Schmidt     The north/south resolution needs to indicate
                             that we decrease in meters as we go from the
                             top to the bottom of the image.  Thus the ns_res
                             needs to be negative or the slope is incorrect.
02/01/2013  Gail Schmidt     Added z scaling for Horn's algorithm.
09/24/2013  Ron Dilley       Added more details as to what the return value
                             actually is.

NOTES:
  1. Algorithm is based on Lambert's cosine law using Horn's algorithm for
     calculating the slope of the current point.  The other option is to use
     Zevenbergen and Thorn's algorithm.  The litterature suggests Zevenbergen
     and Thorne to be more suited to smooth landscapes, whereas Horn's formula
     to perform better on rougher terrain.
  2. Input and output arrays are 1D arrays of size 3 lines x 3 samples where
     the 3x3 indices are and the current pixel being processed is 4.

12/31/2012  Gail Schmidt     Original Development
09/23/2013  Song & Ron       Converted to use non-integerize float for the
                             shaded relief output values.  Added a note about
                             scaling to the NOTES section.

NOTES:
  1. Algorithm is based on the terrain-derived deep shadow algorithm provided
     by Dave Selkowitz, Research Geographer, USGS Alaska Science Center.
  2. Input DEM arrays are 1D arrays of size nlines+[1or2] * nsamps.  An extra
     line should be provided before and after (if possible) the actual subset
     of data to be processed.  Since we are processing an entire line of data
     at a time, it will not be expected that there will be an extra sample on
     either end of the line.  The first and last sample simply will not be
     processed for the shaded relief and the deep shadow mask, thus they should
     already be initialized to an appropriate value before calling this
     function.  The hillshade module requires a 3x3 window to be provided
     surrounding each pixel, thus the extra line(s) of data.
  3. Output mask arrays are 1D arrays of size nlines * nsamps.
  4. The values returned are scaled to a rounded integer (0 to 100).
